## [Tony Huang](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Weidong.Huang) (University of Technology Sydney, Australia)


<p> <strong> Title: </strong> </p>
<p> Evaluation methodologies and practices in information visualisation </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p> Evaluation plays an important role in the design process of effective visualisations. In this talk, we will present general evaluation methodologies, summarise the typical evaluation practices in the information visualisation research and demonstrate how evaluation can help us to test hypotheses and derive new insights from evaluation results. The main take-away messages from this talk will be the understanding of the importance of evaluation and good evaluation practices for different research purposes. </p>

<p> <strong> Title: </strong> </p>
<p> Angular Resolution in Graph Drawing </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p> Angular resolution is one of the well-known aesthetic criteria for graph drawing, but its theoretical properties are not well understood.  For a straight-line drawing of a graph, its vertex angular resolution is the minimum angle formed by two consecutive edges around a vertex, and its crossing angular resolution is the minimum angle formed by a crossing, while the crossing angular resolution is defined to be 360 degrees if there is no crossing.  The total angular resolution of a straight-line drawing is the minimum of the vertex angular resolution and the crossing angular resolution.  The vertex/crossing/total angular resolution of a graph is the supremum of the vertex/crossing/total angular resolution of any straight-line drawing of the graph.  In this talk, we review some of the results on angular resolution in the literature, and identify several open problems in the field. </p>


## [Martin NÃ¶llenburg](https://www.ac.tuwien.ac.at/people/noellenburg/) (Technische Universitat Wien, Austria)

<p> <strong> Title: </strong> </p>
<p> Crossing layout for non-planar graph drawing </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p> Edge crossings are typically undesired in graph drawings as they negatively affect readability. Yet non-planar graphs are abundant in applications and hence we need techniques for better graph layouts in the presence of some edge crossings. We discuss different approaches to improve the geometric representation of crossings and take a look at their corresponding algorithmic problems. </p>
