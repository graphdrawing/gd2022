Ulrik Brandes is professor for social networks at ETH Zürich. His background is in computer science; he obtained a Diploma degree from RWTH Aachen and a doctoral degree from the University of Konstanz with a dissertation on graph drawing. After his habilitation in 2002 he became associate professor at the University of Passau in the same year, and professor for algorithmics at the University of Konstanz one year later. He is vice-president of the International Network for Social Network Analysis (INSNA), coordinating editor of Network Science, and on the editorial boards of Social Networks, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications, and Computer Science Review. From 2007-2014 he served on the Graph Drawing Steering Committee.
<br/>
His main interests are in network analysis and visualization, with application to social networks in particular. He is a co-author of the visone software for network analysis and the GraphML data format. Following a DFG-funded Reinhart Koselleck-Project (2011-2017) on Social Network Algorithmics, he takes a shot at improving the methodological foundations of network science. As a principal investigator in the ERC Synergy Project NEXUS 1492 (2013-2019) he worked on reconstructing archaeological networks from fragmented and heterogeneous observations. Currently, he is devoting more time to network representations in sports analytics.
